# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo: https://player.vimeo.com/video/541326953
#### Description:   This is Voice enabled(trainer) AI fitness trainng machine built on AI using tensorflow, and the precise pose detection helps this app to guide users and ensure physical activity with proper chart



The problem Health NUT (A family Sporter) solves
Exercise has innumerable physical and psychological benefits, including enhanced fitness and heart health, greater strength, better weight management, improved sleep and reduced stress. Meanwhile, families who keep fit with each other see their attachment, social development and emotional management skills improve .This app can help all families irrespective of age to increases self-confidence and reduces anxiety and strengthen family bonds and improve overall mood of both parents and the children . Not getting enough physical activity can lead to heart diseaseâ€”even for people who have no other risk factors. It can also increase the likelihood of developing other heart disease risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. this app will really help seniors to juniors to get indulged in fitness training , and sticking to it in need to increase self confidence and good mental and physical health , the management of voice training with the UI makes the application capable to instruct users to full extent and pose connection with reliable submission to the board on the covered reps helps users to stick with it . we also easily manage his pose to get to know more about the action required on different threads on building up a healthy body to chart it for the same . we believe that we have proudly lead a way to utilize web apps for fitness with fully interactive user experience

Challenges I ran into
building a Model via Tensorflow
Speech Recognition and Voice command

synchronize the offline operation of the word recognition with the online operation of ai recognition
guaranteeing the privacy of users.
securing code
voice commands that are spoken after the imperative ones are sent to the internet which will result with more secure and
greater privacy
offline speech recognition with tensorflow,
posenet with tensorflow or Real-Time-Voice-Cloning for voice modification.
